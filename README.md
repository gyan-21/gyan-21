👋 Hi, I’m @gyan-21

👀 I’m interested in exploring the intersections of technology and creativity. From coding elegant solutions to crafting digital art, I find joy in both logical problem-solving and artistic expression.

🌱 I’m currently learning new ways to integrate machine learning into creative projects. I believe that AI can enhance artistic endeavors in ways we never imagined.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects that involve creative coding, generative art, or innovative applications of AI. If you're working on something exciting, let's join forces and bring our ideas to life!
